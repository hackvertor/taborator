<p>This extension shows the Collaborator client in a tab, and provides notifications of new interactions in the tab title.</p>

<p>To use the extension right click in a repeater tab and choose Taborator-&gt;Insert Collaborator payload. This will create a Collaborator payload that is specific to the extension.
You can also use Taborator-&gt;Insert Collaborator placeholder this will create a placeholder that is replaced with a Collaborator payload when the message is sent.
    The advantage of this is that the original request will be stored and shown in the interactions.</p>
